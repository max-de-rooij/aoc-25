# Remarks on Day 4 of Advent of Code
Day 4 contained no difficult exercises. To be honest, I was craving for a 2D grid exercise by now, given the first three days of this year. It could have genuinely been much more difficult, but now I do have the time to overoptimize solutions.

## Part 1
During this part, I genuinely just brute forced this and got it working quickly.

## Part 2
A brute force approach was also very much doable here. I then proceeded to use dynamic programming to make this more efficient.
