# Remarks on Day 9 of Advent of Code
Today was really difficult. Especially part 2 really got me there. I am not sure if my solution is any good, but I managed to complete it, thankfully. 

## Part 1
This was a simple brute force search. Nothing special.

## Part 2
Over here, my solution relied on the fact that none of the rectangles edges could intersect with any of the edges in the tile shape. I found the largest rectangle for which this was true.
