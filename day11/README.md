# Remarks on Day 11 of Advent of Code
Part 1 was solved with a regular depth-first-search relatively quickly. For part 2, all that needed to be added was a bit of memoization to make the count tractable. I then resumed to use the implementation for part 2 in part 1 as well to clean up the code a bit.

## Part 1
A regular DFS would have sufficed here. But I used part 2's implementation to be reused here.

## Part 2
I used memoization to reduce the number of computations of the DFS which makes this problem tractable. Quite a straightforward problem for today.
